## Algorithmic Accountability Mechanisms: Article 27 and FRIAS

- Commissioned by the Federation of Consumers and Users [CECU](https://cecu.es/) and in collaboration with [IA Ciudadana](https://iaciudadana.org/), I co-authored an exhaustive report on Fundamental Rights Impact Assessments (FRIAS) under the EU AI Act's Article 27. 

This report gives an overview of algorithmic impact assessments and analogue accountability mechanisms to pave the way for a meaningful implementation of FRIAS under Article 27. Drawing from expert interviews and desk research, the report highlights the importance of participatory approaches during the completion of the assessments, drawing from democratic innovation and technology design principles, in a way that avoids or minimizes participant tokenization and ethics washing. Additionally, the report highlights the need for transparency mechanisms in order to ensure oversight and enforcement of the regulation.

## Algorithmic Accountability Reporting Fellowship

- During the first half of 2024, I was part of the [AlgorithmWatch](https://algorithmwatch.org) cohort of investigative journalism fellows. During this 6-month period, my cross-borders group project researched cases of algorithmic harm unfolding in the context of the EU's financial sector. Specifically, I investigated the phenomenon of de-banking. Banks across the world increase their use of automated systems to profile their clients and monitor their transactions under the premise of digitalization and the fight against money laundering and financing of terrorism. De-banking takes place when semi-automated decision-making processes involving algorithms and artificial intelligence go astray, leading to people’s bank accounts being blocked or closed with little to no explanation and, more often than not, devastating consequences. 

This comprehensive body of research yielded a [news story](https://elpais.com/tecnologia/2024-09-24/cuando-un-algoritmo-dicta-erroneamente-el-bloqueo-de-tu-cuenta-bancaria.html) co-authored with journalist Pablo Jiménez Arandia and published in Spain's El País, a [technical report on the use of de-banking for political persecution](https://www.institude.org/report/weaponizing-financial-systems-erdogans-transnational-repression-to-muzzle-dissidents-abroad), and [False Positives](https://algorithmwatch.org/en/false-positives/), a podcast series released by AlgorithmWatch and Agence France-Presse (AFP). 


## Conversations with Practitioners

- As a working group member of [Conversations with Practioners](https://bridges.eaamo.org/working_groups/conversations-with-practitioners/), a globally distributed group of academics, I collaborated in an initiative to bridge knowledge gaps between real-world needs and idealized academic research agendas. The group engaged with practitioners working with marginalized communities across the world by holding conversations where we learned about their experiences in the field. The results of these converations where periodically summarized into [blog posts](https://medium.com/eaamo/interview-with-ivana-feldfeber-f6f22f809ef2). Reflections of the group on these conversations, also yielded a [position paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3689904.3694705) presented at [EAAMO'24](https://conference2024.eaamo.org/conference_information/accepted_papers/). 

During the last two semesters (2024-2025), we collaborated closely with a digital NGO that provides resources and tools to survivors of gender-based violence globally. During this time, I investigated the limits of responsible use of generative AI technologies to be incorporated in their front-end products, co-created case studies on their two products that resort to language models and aligned them with their trauma-informed principles, and observed the execution of their methodology to involve survivors' feedback during product development.
