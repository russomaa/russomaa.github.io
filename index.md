I am an enthusiastic, dedicated researcher with an eclectic skill set and multidisciplinary background. I look forward to a multifaceted career with special sights set on research that can lead to strengthening civic engagement practices and inform evidence-based policies around AI development, deployment, and dismantlement.

My doctoral research focused on the use of semantic data models to document bias in data-driven systems with a multidisciplinary perspective enriched by my experience as a fellow in the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions Innovative Training Networks: [NoBIAS](https://nobias-project.eu/). 

Additionally, I hold a M.Sc. in Data Science and a B.Sc. in Accounting and Finance from the University of Valencia (Spain), and more than five years of working experience in the public and private sectors in project management, accounting, and cost management.
