I am an enthusiastic and dedicated professional with an eclectic background and skill-set.
My  research interests are focused on the identification of practices that can strength civic engagement and inform evidence-based policies around AI development, deployment, and dismantlement.

My doctoral research focused on the use of semantic data models to document bias in data-driven systems with a multidisciplinary perspective enriched by my experience as a fellow in the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions Innovative Training Networks: [NoBIAS](https://nobias-project.eu/). 

Additionally, I hold a M.Sc. in Data Science and a B.Sc. in Accounting and Finance from the University of Valencia (Spain), and more than five years of working experience in the public and private sectors in project management, accounting, and cost management.
