I am an enthusiastic and dedicated professional with an eclectic background and skill set. I am interested in studying the implications of datafication on society with the aim to contribute to the identification of practices that can inform evidence-based policies on the development, deployment, and dismantlement of AI systems. Currently, I am researching the impact of AI on workers' well-being and the future of work. 

My doctoral research focused on the use of semantic data models to document bias in data-driven systems with a multidisciplinary perspective enriched by my experience as a fellow in the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Innovative Training Networks: [NoBIAS](https://nobias-project.eu/). 

Additionally, I hold an M.Sc. in Data Science and a B.Sc. in Accounting and Finance from the University of Valencia (Spain) and more than five years of working experience in the public and private sectors in project management, accounting, and cost management.
